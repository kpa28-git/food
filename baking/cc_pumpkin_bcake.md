# Equip
- 10" Cast Iron Skillet

# Ingredients
## Dry
- 1.5 cups white whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 dashes salt
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3/4 cups chocolate chips

## Wet
- 1 medium banana, mashed
- 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
- 2 eggs, large
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1.25 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil, partially melted

# How
1. First, preheat oven to 350ºF and grease a 10 inch cast iron skillet with around 2 teaspoons of coconut oil.
2. Next, mash 1 banana in a medium-size bowl until it’s smooth and become almost like a liquid. Add in the rest of the liquid ingredients and whisk until combined. Set aside.
3. Place all dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Add in liquid ingredients and combine.
4. Then, pour the batter into your cast iron skillet and bake at 350ºF for 35-40 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean.

# Extra
Get super fancy and top your slice with some homemade cream cheese frosting (3.5 oz cream cheese + 3 tablespoons maple syrup) and then a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds for crunch.
