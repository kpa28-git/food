# Equipment
- Rimmed Baking Sheet + Cooling Rack
- Aluminum Foil
- Meat Thermometer
- Cast Iron Skillet

# Ingredients
## Dry
- 1.5"+ Ribeye Steak | 1.5"+ NY Strip Steak
- 1 Tablespoon Butter
## Wet
- High Heat Cooking Oil
## Seasonings
- Salt+Pepper (optional)

# How
1. Optional: Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Line the Baking sheet with foil, put the cooling rack on top of that, and place the steak on the cooling rack.
3. Put the baking sheet in the oven set between 200°F to 275°F. The lower this is set the more evenly the steak will cook, but the longer it will take. For rare doneness remove the steak at 105°F, for medium-rare remove at 115°F, and for medium remove at 125°F. For a 1.5" steak in a 250°F oven it should take 25-30 min to get to medium rare. For a 1.5" steak in a 220°F oven it should take 50 min to get to medium rare.
5. Heat up the cooking oil on the skillet at high heat so that it is hot enough once you remove the steak from the oven.
6. When it is hot enough, remove the steak from the oven, add the butter, and then add the steak.
7. Sear the steak about 45 seconds each side, also sear the edges.
8. Rest the steak for a minute or two before serving.
