# Ingredients
## Dry
- 1-2 Cups Dry Black Beans
## Seasonings
- Salt
- Any other seasoning

# How
1. Rinse the beans off in cold water.
2. Preparation: Soak the beans in cold water for at least 6H. Overnight (+12H) is best to keep the beans whole. Replace water every few hours if possible. If you are short on time you can use hot water and the beans should finish soaking in about 3H but they will be more likely to break.
3. Put the beans in a large pot with cold water.
4. Bring to a boil.
5. Reduce heat to simmer and put the lid on. Wait 2H.
6. Mix in salt+seasonings at the end to reduce bean breakage.
