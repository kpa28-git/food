# Equipment
- Cast Iron Skillet

# Ingredients
## Dry
- 1-2 cups green beans
## Wet
- 1/5 stick of butter
## Seasonings
- 1 tsp salt
- garlic powder (optional)

# How
1. In a cast iron skillet or heavy-bottom pan, heat butter over medium-high heat
2. Put green beans on pan and add seasonings
3. Let the beans sit in the hot pan for 90 seconds
4. Add more butter if needed. Toss and allow to blister some more (30-90 seconds)

# Extra
Make sure the initial heat is hot enough to blister the green beans before you add them. If the heat is not hot enough you will have to keep them on the pan longer, and they could get soggy or overcooked.
