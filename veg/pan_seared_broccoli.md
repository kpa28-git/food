# Equipment
- Cast Iron Skillet | Heavy Bottom Pan

# Ingredients
## Dry
- 2 Full Heads Broccoli
## Wet
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
## Seasonings
- 1 tsp salt
- ¼-1/2 tsp pepper

# How
1. In a cast iron skillet or heavy-bottom pan, heat olive oil over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, prepare the broccoli by cutting entire head of broccoli in half. Laying the flat side down, cut off each floret from the base of the floret all the way down to the bottom of the stem.
3. When the oil is hot, add all the broccoli to the pan, arranging so that as many pieces as possible are touching the bottom of the pan. Season with ½ tsp salt plus pepper to taste and allow to cook for 5 minutes, undisturbed.
4. After 5 minutes, stir and rearrange the broccoli so that the sides that were down are now facing up. Season again with salt and pepper and cover with a lid. Allow to cook for 3 more minutes.
5. Stir before serving. Best when served hot.

# Extra
The key to producing that delicious, perfect brown crust is not to stir the broccoli during that first 5 minutes. So don’t stir it!

I recommend using a cast iron skillet (which means you can use it over an open fire OR on the grill too!), but you can use any heavy-bottomed pan as well.
